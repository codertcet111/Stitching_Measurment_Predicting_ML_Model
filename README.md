# Stitching_Measurment_Predicting_ML_Model

In the Stitching_Prediction.ipynb model, the ML model will predict stitching measurments such as, 'size around ankle' and many others on the basis of few mesurments such as, 'chest size', 'height' etc.

The file 'stitching dump.xlsx' in .xls format contain unprocessed data, whereas the another file 'stitching dump.xlsx' in .csv format contains the well processed data.

In this model we have trained the data and predicted measurments. We have used multiple target regression model. This model internally uses KNN algorithm for each target variables prediction.

What you can do is that by changing the training and testing data's portion and few athor changes in model and enjoy predictions accuracy.
